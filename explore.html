                <p>Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there’s
                    plenty to see and do.</p><br>
                <p>You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet
                    our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so
                    make sure you come ready to learn and explore.</p><br>
                <p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
                    you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.</p><br>
                <p>During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to
                    go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
                    the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.</p><br>

                <p>As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create places of learning and
                    exploring. Our team are on hand to give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
                    learning laboratory,
                    and provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them.</p><br>
                <p>Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring

        <h2>COSMOLOGY</h2>
        <section class="exploreSection1">
            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
                and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
                galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
                latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

        <h2>EVOLUTION</h2>
        <section class="exploreSection2">
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we
                come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
                for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                <br><br> Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our
                time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
                Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE</h2>
        <section class="exploreSection3">
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
                into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to
                the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
                heart transplant.
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals
                in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

        <h2>ROBOTICS AND AI</h2>
        <section class="exploreSection4">
            <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
                future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can
                even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot</p>

        <h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
        <section class="exploreSection5">
            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes
                that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
                warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                contribute to a brighter future.
